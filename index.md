This is the [University of Manchester's](http://www.manchester.ac.uk) course on programming in R from [Research IT](http://www.itservices.manchester.ac.uk/research/).  

The course is currently under development. 

> ## Prerequisites
>
> You should be able to:
> * Use R to load delimited data
> * Manipulate tibbles or data frames
> * Subset vectors
> * Know how to plot data.
>
> The Research IT course [R for data analysis](https://uomresearchit.github.io/r-tidyverse-intro/) covers these prerequisites, using the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org).  
> We will be using the tidyverse in parts of this course, so familiarity with its main packages (readr, ggplot, dlpyr) would be useful.
