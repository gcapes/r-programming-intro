In the previous episodes we showed how to create functions, and test that they are working.  In this episode we will use these ideas, and expand on them to load the weather data that you downloaded at the start of the course.  

The `data` directory contains a series of files, which contain hourly weather observations from an observatory.  Let's work through the process of how to load all these files into a single (large) data-set.  There is a file, `met_README` that explains the file naming convention and the format of the data in the files. Take a look at the README file, and at one of the files containing the weather data.

The README file explains that the "Fields in each line are delimited by whitespace." This is the same as the CO2 data,
which suggests we can use `read_table()` to load a file.  The missing data value in the CO2 data was all `-999.99`. The README file states that the missing data for some fields are different from this (for example, the missing value for wind direction is `-999`).

## Getting started

Let's load one of the weather files into R, using the `read_table()` function, as we already know how to do this.
We'll use the following command, so that we are all using the same variable names (you should copy and paste
this command to save typing):

FIXME? Get participants to generate col_types and check sensible guesses?

```{r}
weather <- read_table("data/met_mlo_insitu_1_obop_hour_1977.txt",
                      col_names = c("obs",
                                    "yyyy",
                                    "mm",
                                    "dd",
                                    "hh",
                                    "winddir",
                                    "windspeed",
                                    "windsteadiness",
                                    "pressure",
                                    "temperature2m",
                                    "temperature10m",
                                    "temperaturetop",
                                    "relhumidity",
                                    "precipitation" ),
                      col_types = cols(
                        obs = col_character(),
                        yyyy = col_integer(),
                        mm = col_character(),
                        dd = col_character(),
                        hh = col_character(),
                        winddir = col_integer(),
                        windspeed = col_double(),
                        windsteadiness = col_integer(),
                        pressure = col_double(),
                        temperature2m = col_double(),
                        temperature10m = col_double(),
                        temperaturetop = col_double(),
                        relhumidity = col_integer(),
                        precipitation = col_integer()
                      )
)

```

## An improved field cleaning function

In contrast to the CO2 data, the value used to represent missing data depends on the 
field.   Let's modify our `cleanfields()` function so that we can (optionally) specify
the missing value we want to use for each field.

We will need to provide a
way of giving the function a list of variable names *and* the value that we
should treat as missing.

One way of doing this is to provide a named vector of missing values.  We
can assign names to elements of a vector in R:

```{r}
missingvalues <- c(winddir = -999, windspeed = -999.9, temperature10m = -999.9)
missingvalues

```
We can extract the names of the vector using the `names()` function:
```{r}
names(missingvalues)
```


> ## More on `names()`
> 
> In addition to getting the names of an object, we can also use the `names()` function to set the names of an object:
> 
> ```{r}
> myvec <- c(1,2,3)
> names(myvec) <- c("a","b","c")
> myvec
> ```
{: .callout}


Let's modify our function so that it calls `cleanfield()` with its default `missingvalue` argument if our vector of fields
to clean doesn't have names, and calls `cleanfield()` with the appropriate missing value if we have specified names.

As we have already written tests to check that `cleanfields()` works properly, we can modify our function knowing that
if we break anything, this should be revealed in the tests we have written.  

In pseudo-code, this is what we want to do:


```

cleanfields <- function(dataset, fieldlist){
  
  if( fieldstoclean doesn't have names ){
    run existing code
  } else {
    clean the fields according to the values passed and their names
  }

  return our results
}

```

There are two things we will need to figure out:

1. How to test whether `fieldstoclean` has names
2. How to write the code that will be executed if `fieldstoclean` has names


We used the `names()` function to extract the names of a named vector.  Let's look at how we can use
this to generate a condition that evaluates to `TRUE` or `FALSE` depending on whether a vector has names:

```{r}
withnames <- c(name1 = 1, name2 = 2.2)
nonames <- c("name1", "name2")

names(withnames) # Will give us the names if there are any

names(nonames) # Or NULL if there are not
```

This gets us most of the way there; but there is a problem.  Usually we can test if values are equal to each other using
`==` ( or `all.equal()` if we're dealing with floating point numbers).  This doesn't work for "special" values, like `NULL`, `NA`
and `Inf`:
```{r}

x <- NULL
# But NULL isn't TRUE (or FALSE)
x == NULL
# We need to use:
is.null(NULL)
```

> ## Indenting your code
> 
> As our code becomes more complex, keeping it tidy becomes increasingly important.  One way of doing this is
> by indenting your code, so that everything at the same "level", e.g. everything that will be executed `if` a condition is
> true, has the same indent. RStudio performs this indentation for you automatically.  You may find it gets out of sync

We should now write the final part of the function.   We will need to loop over each element of the named `fieldlist`
vector

```{r, include=FALSE}
cleanfields <- function(dataset, fieldlist){
  
  if ( is.null(names(fieldlist)) ) {
    
    if ( !all(fieldlist %in% names(dataset)) ) {
      stop("Attempting to clean variables that do not exist in the dataset")

    } 
  }
  
  return(dataset) 
  
}
```


## Processing a file

We now have all the elements we need to load and process a file.  We can:

* Load a file using `read_table()`
* Make the datetime field, using `ymd_h()`
* Clean the data using `cleandataset()`

Let's combine these functions into a single function.  This will take a single argument; the name of the file
it is to read.  

```{r}
loadWeatherData <- function(infile){
  # Load in a weather data file
  
  weather <- read_table(infile,
                        col_names = c("obs",
                                      "yyyy",
                                      "mm",
                                      "dd",
                                      "hh",
                                      "winddir",
                                      "windspeed",
                                      "windsteadiness",
                                      "pressure",
                                      "temperature2m",
                                      "temperature10m",
                                      "temperaturetop",
                                      "relhumidity",
                                      "precipitation" ),
                        col_types = cols(
                          obs = col_character(),
                          yyyy = col_integer(),
                          mm = col_character(),
                          dd = col_character(),
                          hh = col_character(),
                          winddir = col_integer(),
                          windspeed = col_double(),
                          windsteadiness = col_integer(),
                          pressure = col_double(),
                          temperature2m = col_double(),
                          temperature10m = col_double(),
                          temperaturetop = col_double(),
                          relhumidity = col_integer(),
                          precipitation = col_integer()
                        )
  )
  
  
  weather <- weather %>% mutate(recdate = lubridate::ymd_h(paste(yyyy,mm,dd,hh)))
  
  missingvalues <- c(winddir = -999,
                     windspeed = -999.9,
                     windsteadiness = -9,
                     pressure = -999.9,
                     temperature2m = -999.9,
                     temperature10m = -999.9,
                     temperaturetop = -999.9,
                     relhumidity = -99,
                     precipitation = -99)
  weather <- cleanfields(weather, missingvalues)
  
  return(weather)
}

cleanweather <- loadWeatherData("data/met_mlo_insitu_1_obop_hour_1977.txt")
```

## Checking our load has worked

The `summary()` function will show us summary statistics for each variable in a data-set.  Let's use this to
check that our data looks reasonable:
The summary shows that some variables, e.g. `winddir` have large, positive values:

```{r}
summary(cleanweather)
```

It looks like the cleaning process hasn't worked properly!   We've tested our `cleanfields()` function, so we can be reasonably confident that is working properly (it's possible that something has gone wrong that we *haven't* tested for).  So what's going on?
## Hunting bugs

Hunting a bug down can be very difficult.   They're often "obvious" once you've found them (it's often the case that the more "obvious" the bug the longer it takes to find).  There are a number of techniques we can use to help us:

* We can print out statements (using `print()` so we know which bits of code are being run)
* We can use a debugger to pause the program execution and look at the values of variables _within_ the function


Take a look at our `loadWeatherData()` function; it does two main things: loads the data and cleans it (it also creates the `recdate` field - but that looks OK in our summary).  We'd like to know what the `weather` tibble looks like once we've read it in, but _before_ we've cleaned it - we can use this to help work out whether the problem is with the data itself (i.e. the file doesn't conform to the specificiation), our loading the data or our cleaning of the data.

Find the line in your code where we generate the `recdate` field, and click to the left of the line number, as shown below:  You should find a red circle appears next to the line.  This creates a breakpoint.  If we run the code again, 

![Debugger screenshot](../fig/debugger.png)

When we run the code again, by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>, it will stop on the selected line _before it is executed_.  We can look at the contents of the weather tibble by entering its name in the console window.  

> ## Challenge
> 
> Use the `summary()` function (or other methods of your choice) to work out whether the problem is with our cleaning function or with what's being read in.  If there are problems with what's being read in, find a record which appears to be incorrect (perhaps uing, `filter()`).  Take a look at the raw data-file to establish whether the problem is with our _reading in_ of the data, or the data itself.

In the challenge we deduced that the issue was with how the `read_table()` function is reading the data in.  

Take a look a the help file for `read_table()` - it shows that there is also a function `read_table2()`, which "is like read.table(), [but] it allows any number of whitespace characters between columns, and the lines can be of different lengths."

Let's try this:

```{r}
loadWeatherData <- function(infile){
  # Load in a weather data file
  
  weather <- read_table2(infile,
                        col_names = c("obs",
                                      "yyyy",
                                      "mm",
                                      "dd",
                                      "hh",
                                      "winddir",
                                      "windspeed",
                                      "windsteadiness",
                                      "pressure",
                                      "temperature2m",
                                      "temperature10m",
                                      "temperaturetop",
                                      "relhumidity",
                                      "precipitation" ),
                        col_types = cols(
                          obs = col_character(),
                          yyyy = col_integer(),
                          mm = col_character(),
                          dd = col_character(),
                          hh = col_character(),
                          winddir = col_integer(),
                          windspeed = col_double(),
                          windsteadiness = col_integer(),
                          pressure = col_double(),
                          temperature2m = col_double(),
                          temperature10m = col_double(),
                          temperaturetop = col_double(),
                          relhumidity = col_integer(),
                          precipitation = col_integer()
                        )
  )
  
  
  weather <- weather %>% mutate(recdate = lubridate::ymd_h(paste(yyyy,mm,dd,hh)))
  
  missingvalues <- c(winddir = -999,
                     windspeed = -999.9,
                     windsteadiness = -9,
                     pressure = -999.9,
                     temperature2m = -999.9,
                     temperature10m = -999.9,
                     temperaturetop = -999.9,
                     relhumidity = -99,
                     precipitation = -99)
  weather <- cleanfields(weather, missingvalues)
  
  return(weather)
}

cleanweather <- loadWeatherData("data/met_mlo_insitu_1_obop_hour_1977.txt")
summary(cleanweather)
```

This looks much better, with the exception of the windspeed data, which has `-99.9` as its minimum.  If we check back to the original data, it looks like they are using this as their "missing" value for windspeed, and not `-999.9` as it says in the README.

It (finally) looks like we've read the data in successfully.   

Although this has been quite a protracted
episode it highlights some of the typical problems you will come accross when dealing with real-life data.  We've spent a lot of time on looking at how to work out what's gone wrong, and how to fix it, using a combination of testing and debugging.   It's quite normal to spend a lot of time on these aspects of programming; this is fine.
